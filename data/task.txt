(do NOT use the name "redcarpet" in the repo) 
dataset: http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small.zip
 (datset has movies and ratings as CSV files)
 Do all of this in a jupyter notebook Load the dataset into pyspark dataframes as well as a separate pyspark RDD 
Create an association matrix (for movies vs ratings) using alternating least squares (ALS) - do this for both the dataframe as well as the RDD. Compare them and mark the differences.
